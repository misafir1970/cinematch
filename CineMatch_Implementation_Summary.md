### API Endpoints Added
```
GET  /api/recommendations/:userId     - Get personalized recommendations
POST /api/track-action               - Record user actions
GET  /api/user-profile/:userId       - Get user profile and stats
GET  /api/user-actions/:userId       - Get user action history
POST /api/ml/train                   - Trigger model training
